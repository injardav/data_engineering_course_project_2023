# Data Engineering (LTAT.02.007) Project 
Designing and Implementing a Data Pipeline to Analyze Scientific Publications.

This project is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in data engineering, modeling,
and analytics while tackling real-world challenges in the realm of scientific publications data. The
project's primary objective is to master the art of crafting multi-faceted analytical views and
ensure the data pipeline's repeatability. As we delve into this endeavor, we will explore diverse
analytical perspectives, from building data warehouses and data marts for Business Intelligence
(BI) queries to harnessing the capabilities of graph databases for tasks like co-authorship
prediction and community analysis. Moreover, we will delve into the intricacies of data
transformations, data cleansing, and data augmentation, ultimately preparing you to address the
complexities of real-world data engineering projects."
